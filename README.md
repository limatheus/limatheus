### Hi there my name is Matheus Lima

Technology enthusiast. I have a real passion for development, functional and clean design  and a appetite for continual learning, I typically manifest by my community contributions (e.g., open source work, publishing / speaking on technical ideas).

Always obsessed with mastering the newest programming techniques and skills. You can find me constantly pouring over the latest articles and tutorials 

I can contribute across several technical activities, including development-heavy and low-code activities, such as data engineering, software development, system/ product configuration and DevOps.
